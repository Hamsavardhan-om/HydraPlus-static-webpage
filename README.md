# HydraPlus - Static landing page and dashboard

Website URL: https://hydraplus.netlify.app

This project implements basic frontend core concepts to build a static webpage that uses modern HTML5 and CSS3 concepts. 

It uses:

- Modern and Semantic HTML for markup with minimum usage of Non-semantic tags like `<div` and `<span>`.
- CSS uses layering with dedicated reset and components layer to default the style and group UI components into a single layer.
- Usage of FlexBox and Grid, including @media and @container queries to make it highly responsive.
- Pseudo-classes & Pseudo-elements demonstrates modern UI interactivity and styling tricks with minimum javaScript.
- Use of CSS variables for consistent theme shifts based on user preference (Light and Dark).
